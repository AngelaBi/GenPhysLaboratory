## Background

```{admonition} OVERALL GOALS
:class: note
Use a parallel-plate capacitor to create a uniform electric field to:
  - Investigate the relationship between electric force $F_E$ and voltage $V$ (i.e. $F_E$ vs. $V$).
  - Experimentally determine the electric constant $\varepsilon_0$.
```

The electric constant, $\varepsilon_0$ (pronounced "epsilon nought" or "epsilon zero"), is a fundamental constant of nature. Also known as vacuum permittivity, permittivity of free space, or dielectric permittivity of the vacuum, it is a measure of how dense of an electric field is "permitted" to form in response electric charges. As such, it is also the proportionality constant that relates the **electric force between two charges**. The constant $\varepsilon_0$ is also related to the constant $k$ in Coulomb's Law which describes the electrostatic force $F_E$ between charges:

```{math}
:label: eq_coulomb_basic
F = F_\text{electric} = F_E = k\frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r^2},
```

where $Q$ is the charge in Coulombs, $r$ is the separation distance between charges in meters, and

```{math}
:label: eq_k_epsilon
k = \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0}.
```

The subscript zero refers to the baseline value of the permittivity of free space. 


If we apply Coulomb's law to the special case of two *large*, *closely-spaced*, *parallel plates*, we can derive an expression for the electric force between the two plates. This configuration is known as the **parallel-plate capacitor** (example in {numref}`E1Fig_0001`).

```



<!---
When a voltage $V$ is applied between the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor, charge is distributed evenly, such that total the surface charge density is $\sigma = Q/A$; charge $Q$ is distributed across the area $A$ of each plate in equal, but opposite sign. If looking as just a single plate by themselves, it creates its own electric field on either side of the plate such that the electric field for one side of the plate is due to half of the charge, leading to a magnitude $E_\text{singlePlateSide} = \frac{\sigma}{2 \varepsilon_0} = \frac{Q}{2 \varepsilon_0 A}$. 


(i.e. as if the charges are distributed on both the inside of the capacitor and outside of the capacitor).

When the distance $d$ between the plates is small, the charges from each plate create a uniform electric field between the plates with magnitude $E = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0} = \frac{Q}{\varepsilon_0 A}$. This describes how dense of an electric field is permitted to form due to the surface charges.

Now since the electric field is uniform, we can also describe the potential difference as $V = Ed$, which can be rearranged to show the *total* magnitude of the electric field from both plates as $E = \frac{V}{d}$, with $V$ as the voltage (potential difference) between the plates, and $d$ the separation distance between parallel plates.

To create the uniform field between the plates, we must note that each plate themselves create their own electric fields that **act soley on the opposite plate** (an individual plate's field cannot affect itself). We must also recognize that the charge $Q$ is distributed across both sides of a individual plate, so the electric field generated by one side of a single plate is due to half of the charge. This leads to the electric field for a single plate becomes thus just half, $E_\text{single} = \frac{\sigma}{2 \varepsilon_0} = \frac{Q}{2 \varepsilon_0 A}$. The electric force that the charges on the opposite plate would feel is $F = Q E_

is electric fields subsequently applies an electric force on the charges of the opposite plate. Outside the plates, the electric field cancels out

From electrostatics, we know the ele

--->

The electric field is uniform with a magnitude $E = \frac{V}{d}$, with $V$ as the voltage (potential difference) between the plates, and $d$ the separation distance between parallel plates. The electric force of attraction between two oppositely charged plates is then

```{math}
:label: eq_electric_force
F_E = \frac{\varepsilon_0 A V^{2}}{2 d^{2}}
```

where $A$ is the area of the plates, $d$ the separation distance, and $V$ the potential difference in volts across the plates.

*{eq}`eq_electric_force` is valid only under the conditions stated of large, closely spaced plates to provide a uniform electric field and charge density so we can effectively ignore fringe fields*. The physical implications of these geometric assumptions is that the electric field is totally confined to the space between the plates and is constant in value throughout the space. You will see in Lab E-2 that the electric field always 'bulges' or fringes out at the edge. For {eq}`eq_electric_force`, the fringe field is ignored. Rewriting the expression for $\varepsilon_0$, we obtain

```{math}
:label: eq_epsilon_0
\varepsilon_0 = \frac{2 F_E d^{2}}{A V^{2}}.
```

By measuring electric force, voltage, and geometry of the apparatus, $\varepsilon_0$ can be determined.

### Adjustment of apparatus (check with Instructor if needed)

The apparatus has been carefully adjusted before your lab and should not require further significant adjustments. This section describes how the apparatus was prepared. If something seems to need adjusting, see the lab instructor.

1. The beam lift (knob location noted in {numref}`E1Fig_00` bottom-left) provides a definite location for the beam and thus guarantees continued alignment of the parallel plates. Use the beam lift each time you change weights or relocate the counter weight.
2. Both plates can be adjusted vertically and horizontally in order to make it possible for the plates to be parallel. The counterweight behind the mirror can be used to establish the equilibrium separation of the plates. The plates should have already been adjusted parallel with the counterweight set so the plates are essentially parallel when a 50 mg mass is placed on the movable plate. *If the plates are NOT parallel with the 50 mg mass in place, seek the instructor's help.*
3. The apparatus can be leveled with the leveling screws so that it sits flat on the table.
4. Mirror-to-scale distance was measured from rear of mirror (reflective surface) to ~center of $S_0$ and $S_1$ on the scale (ruler).

  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! UPDATE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  --->

```{admonition} OVERVIEW
:class: note
   - Experimentally investigate the relationship between electric force and applied voltage to determine the electric constant $\varepsilon_0$.
  - Conduct three rounds of six trials each (total 18 trials) of applying less mass (less gravitational force) and more voltage to produce an electric field (and therefore more electric force) to account for the loss of gravitational force. 
  - In this experiment, you will:
    - Determine the separation distance between the parallel plates, $d$
    - Replace equilibrium mass with a series of smaller masses
    - Apply the necessary voltage $V$ to the plates such that they return to parallel and $d$
      - Under this condition, the electric force required to maintain the separation $d$ will be the difference of the gravitational force of the equilibrium and smaller applied mass.
    - Determine $\varepsilon_0$ for each trial (ignroing equilibrium mass)
    - Determine average $\varepsilon_0$ of all your trials (ignroing equilibrium mass)
    - Determine $\varepsilon_0$ from plotting of all your data (including equilibrium mass) as $F_E\,\text{vs.}\,V^2$
    - Comparing then your results from both analysis methods to the accepted $\varepsilon_{0\text{-accepted}}$.
```

```{admonition} Additional Tips
:class: tip
- Do the rounds sequentially rather than all of a single applied mass in a row to ensure you catch and correct any significant errors early (e.g. if the apparatus is bumped out of alignment) rather than having to do all 18 trials again. 
- The order of the trials for applied masses wwill be 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 0, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 0, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 0 mg. Reminder, 50 mg is equilibrium mass when the power supply if off (i.e. applied voltage is zero).
```

```{admonition} Combining results from today's lab with future $\mu_0$ lab for **speed of light** $c$
:class: note
You will experimentally determine $\varepsilon_0$ today; a few weeks from now in Lab: {ref}`Magnetic Force & the Determination of μ₀ <magnetic-force-mu0-overall>`, you will determine its magnetic equivalent, $\mu_0$. Using both in that later lab, we will be able to determine the speed of light (i.e. magnitude of the velocity of propagation of an electromagnetic wave). You will want to make sure to take note of your value $\varepsilon_0$ for future use.

1. Prepare a common data table including given values.
   Reminder -- keep variable names and units in the row and column titles, and numbers in their own Excel cells to be able to reference in your equations. **Run all your calculations in your Excel sheet so your instructor can see how you arrived at your final results**. Include, but not limited to:
    - $g = 9.803 \,\text{m/s}^2$: Accepted value of accel. due to garvity for Fairfield University
    - $\varepsilon_{0\text{,actual}} = 8.8542\times 10^{-12}\,\text{C}^2 \, \text{N}^{-1} \text{m}^{-2}$: Accepted value of electric constant
    <!---   - $a \pm \delta a=0.279\pm0.001\,\meter$: Length of the frame (see Fig.~\ref{E1Fig:01}) --->
    - $a=0.279\,\text{m}$: Length of the frame from pivot to end of plate (see {numref}`E1Fig_01`)
    <!---   - $b \pm \delta b = b \pm 0.003\meter$: Mirror-to-scale distance, has already been measured and is posted on the top of the protective enclosure ({numref}`E1Fig_01` bottom) --->
    - $b$: Mirror-to-scale distance, has already been measured and is posted on the top of the protective enclosure ({numref}`E1Fig_01` bottom)
    - $A \pm \delta A =0.0161\pm0.0002\,\meter^2$: Plate area ({numref}`E1Fig_01`)
    - $A=0.0161\,\meter^2$: Plate area ({numref}`E1Fig_01`)
    - $m_0 = 50\,\text{mg}$: Equilibrium mass (plates are parallel when this amount of mass applied).
    - $F_0 = m_0 g$: Equilibrium force
    - $S_{0}$: Scale reading at equilibrium (m)
    - $S_{1}$: Scale reading when plates are in contact (m)
    - $d$: Separation distance between the plates when the top plate is **parallel** to the bottom plate when equilibrium mass ($50\,\text{mg}$) is placed on the top plate (see examples in {numref}`E1Fig_01` top-right and {numref}`E1Fig_02` middle)

2. **Do not turn on the power supply until told to do so in the steps below.**
3. Note the center marking "+" on the top of the movable plate where masses must be placed using the tweezers (see {numref}`E1Fig_03`).

4. Investigate the use of the telescope and scale so that the rotation of the balanced frame can be measured in terms of scale divisions (see {numref}`E1Fig_02`). Numbers are in cm, small lines in mm.

```

5. Determine separation distance $d$ of the plates when they are essentially parallel. To do so, perform a geometrical analysis that describes the vertical displacement of the plate as given by

```{math}
:label: eq_distance_d
d = \frac{D a}{2 b}
```

where $D$ is the change in scale reading between when the equilibrium mass is on the plate and when the plates are in contact (example shown in {numref}`E1Fig_02`) and $a$ and $b$ as described earlier (further described in {numref}`E1Fig_01`). The factor of 2 results from the fact that the optical path reflected off of the mirror to the scale rotates through an angle twice that of the beam holding the movable plate. Determine $D = | S_1 - S_0 |$ from two scale readings (reminders: absolute value there is to represent the total distance between $S_0$ and $S_1$. If your crosshair crosses 0, make sure to consider the negative).

   - The first scale reading, $S_0$, is made when the separation of the plates is such that the plates are essentially parallel. This should happen when a mass of 50 mg is on the movable plate. If not, call over an instructor.
   - The second scale reading, $S_1$, is made when the top plate contacts the bottom plate ({numref}`E1Fig_02`). Place a sufficient mass (~500 mg) on the movable plate to make it contact the lower, stationary plate.
   - You should periodically verify that $S_0$ and $S_1$ are not changed.
   - Record $S_0$, $S_1$, and $D = | S_1 - S_0 |$ in your common data table.
   - Also include the equilibrium mass $m_0$, the equilibrium force ${F_0 = m_0 g}$, the distance $a$, the distance $b$ found on the apparatus cover.
   - Calculate the plate spacing $d$ using {eq}`eq_distance_d`.

### Experimental Data Collection
For each case, perform the following:


   - We can now determine an experimental value of $\varepsilon_0$ from the values in the common data table and the experimental voltage from each trial. You will perform at least three trials for each of six cases of different applied masses on the movable plate (18 total trials). Set up an experimental data table to record your measurements and calculate the experimental value of $\varepsilon_0$. Include enough rows for trials and columns for:
      - Applied mass $m_{\text{applied}}$
      <!---  - Applied mass uncertainty $\delta m_{\text{applied}} = 0.01 \times m_{\text{applied}}$ (i.e. 1\%) --->
      - Applied force $F_{\text{applied}}=m_{\text{applied}} g$
      <!---   - Uncertainty in the applied force $\delta F_{\text{applied}} = (m_{\text{applied}} + \delta m_{\text{applied}})g - F_{\text{applied}}$. This comes from the difference in a maximized value for the applied force and your value for the applied force. --->
      - Electric force $F_E$ as the difference between the equilibrium force and the applied force $F_E=F_0 - F_{\text{applied}}$
      - Voltage $V$ required to return to the equilibrium position
      - $\delta V$: Estimated volatage uncertainty
      - Experimental value of the electric constant $\varepsilon_{0\text{-experimental}}$ as calculated using {eq}`eq_epsilon_0`.

6. Repeat the following steps for each trial with applied masses in order (to catch any procedural issues early): 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 0, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 0, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 0 mg. Replace the equilibrium mass in the center of the top plate with the mass required for each trial. The top plate will swing upwards.

```

7. Turn on the power supply and slowly increase the voltage until the plate separation is reduced back to the equilibrium value, $S_0$, as it was with 50 mg on the top plate (determined by watching the scale reading with the telescope). The telescope observer should be calling out instructions to the power supply operator to slowly approach the $S_0$ value. When the $S_0$ value is reached, call out immediately for a voltage reading and record the voltage. Since the electric force will increase with decreasing separation, as seen from {eq}`eq_electric_force`, the plates have a tendency to continue through the $S_0$ point towards the zero separation point $S_1$. $S_0$ is an unstable equilibrium point. This may result in the plates sticking together and sparking as seen in {numref}`E1Fig_04`. If the plates stick together, **DO NOT TOUCH THE APPARATUS TO SEPARATE THE PLATES**. Turn off the power supply and tap the table in front of the apparatus; the plates should separate themselves. Accurate readings require care that the telescope and scale are not moved during the experiment. Note: If the voltmeter display times out and goes blank, turn it off and on and reset the voltmeter to DC volts (sleep function).

7. WIGGLE THE VOLTAGE TO FIND THE $V_\text{max}$ --- solve to $\delta V$.

somewhere in here maximize and minimize $\varepsilon_0$ due to the uncertainty $\delta V$

8. Reduce the voltage to zero and turn off the power supply. You should periodically check that $S_0$ and $S_1$ have not changed during your experiment.

9. Record the values for: the applied mass and voltage required for equilibrium. Calculate the applied force, the difference between the equilibrium force and the applied force (electric force), and the value of $\varepsilon_{0_\text{experimental}}$ calculated using {eq}`eq_epsilon_0`.

10. Repeat Steps 7 through 9 for each subsequent trial and record corresponding values.

11. Check if all the values are reasonably consistent. Retake any data that are clearly erroneous and recalculate.

12. Add rows to your data table for calculating:
    - Average $\varepsilon_{0_\text{experimental-average}}$
    - Standard deviation $\sigma_{\varepsilon_{\text{0-experimental-average}}}$ (treating this as your overall uncertainty of your average value, e.g. avg ± σ. *Consider: does your experimental value ± range overlap with the accepted value of $\varepsilon_{0}$?*

13. **Graphical Analysis:**

    - The graphical display of data permits the comparison of all the values and associated errors at once. Points that depart markedly from the general trend of the data are quickly detected. We expect from theory (from {eq}`eq_electric_force`) that electric force and voltage are related like:

    ```{math}
    :label: eq_force_voltage
    F_E = \alpha V^{2}.
    ```

    - Using **all** of your data points from **all cases and trials**, including those at equilibrium that you should have ignored earlier when you calculated $\varepsilon_0$ for each individual trial and overall average:

      1. ***SCATTER PLOT*** $F_E$ as ordinate ($y$) and $V^{2}$ as abscissa ($x$). Fit a trend line through the all these points, display the trendline equation on the chart, and confirm the slope of the line $\alpha$ matches what you found with the LINEST() function. From {eq}`eq_electric_force`, the value of $\alpha$ is given by

      ```{math}
      :label: eq_alpha
      \alpha = \varepsilon_0\frac{A}{2 d^2}.
      ```

      $\varepsilon_0$ can now be determined by rearranging {eq}`eq_alpha` and using this experimentally determined value $\alpha$. Thus

      ```{math}
      :label: eq_epsilon_from_alpha
      \varepsilon_0 = \frac{2 \alpha d^2}{A}.
      ```

      2. ***SCATTER PLOT*** $F_E$ vs. $V$. Fit a quadratic trend line, and display the equation. 

    ```{admonition} Discussion Point: Linear vs. Quadratic
    :class: question
    Notice the shape of the data. How does this compare to your first plot?
    - What is the physical relationship between $F_E$ and $V$? What does it mean for electric force when voltage is doubled?
    - Would you expect the linear fit to go through the **origin** of the $F_E$ vs. $V^2$ plot? 
    ```

<!---    !!!!! CUT OUT DOING THE Y-INTERCEPT ~~~~~!!!!!!!!!!


    b. Your best fit line to $F_E$ versus $x=V^{2}$ should theoretically pass though the origin. Change the fit to force the line to have a $y$ intercept of 0. Recalculate your value of $\varepsilon_0$ as above.
