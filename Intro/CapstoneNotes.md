```{admonition} Recording/Deleting Data in Capstone
:class: tip
*NEVER* need to click the Delete Last Run button in **Capstone**. ![dontDeleteCapstone](../ExperimentsGenPhysI/CentripetalForceFigures/Figure10_v2025-01.png) **Capstone** will just hold on to that data as a past trial that you could go back and look at as needed. When you press Record, **Capstone** will just create a new *Run* of data to keep track of.
