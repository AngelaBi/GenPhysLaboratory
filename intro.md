# Welcome to General Physics Lab

This set of lab courses engage students in experimental measurements spanning the areas of mechanics and thermal stresses on matter to electromagnetic phenomena, with the objective of training students in experimental measurements, data manipulation and analysis, error analysis, deductive thinking, and instrumentation. They aim to provide depth to students' understanding of the physical phenomena taught in lecture. 

Specific experimental measurements for Gen. Phys. I include forces, accelerated motion, ballistics, centripetal force and rotational dynamics, conservation of energy and momentum, 
thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, and periodic motion. 

Specific experimental measurements for Gen. Phys. II that cover electric and magnetic phenomena includes electric forces, voltage, electric fields, electron motion, resistance and capacitance, magnetic fields, magnetic forces, electromagnetic induction, wave motion, and geometric optics.

Students will complete a weekly lab writeup.


This laboratory provides students with a greater understanding of electromagnetic phenomena, wave phenomena, and optics, and supports PHYS 1146. Measurements of microscopic quantities, like the This course trains students in experimental measurements, data analysis, error analysis, deductive thinking, and instrumentation.


This page includes all the experiments for:
- Gen Phys I --- PHYS1171L & PHYS1145L
- Gen Phys II --- PHYS1172L & PHYS1146L
