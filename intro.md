# Welcome to General Physics Lab

This set of lab courses engage students in experimental measurements spanning the areas of mechanics and thermal stresses on matter to electromagnetic phenomena. The objective of these courses is to train students in experimental measurements, data manipulation and analysis, error analysis, deductive thinking, and instrumentation. They aim to also provide depth to students' understanding of the physical phenomena taught in lecture (namely PHY1145/1171 and 1146/1172).

Specific experimental measurements for Gen. Phys. I Lab (PHY1145L/1171L) include forces, accelerated motion, ballistics, centripetal force and rotational dynamics, conservation of energy and momentum, 
thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, and periodic motion. 

Specific experimental measurements for Gen. Phys. II Lab (PHY1146L/1172L) that cover electric and magnetic phenomena includes electric forces, voltage, electric fields, electron motion, resistance and capacitance, magnetic fields, magnetic forces, electromagnetic induction, wave motion, and geometric optics.

Students will complete a weekly lab writeup.

This page includes all the experiments for:
- General Physics I Lab --- PHYS1145L & PHYS1171L
- General Physics II Lab --- PHYS1146L & PHYS1172L
