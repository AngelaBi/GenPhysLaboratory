# Welcome to General Physics Lab

This lab course engages students in experimental measurements spanning the areas of mechanics and thermal stresses on matter, with the objective of training students in experimental measurements, data manipulation and analysis, error analysis, deductive thinking, and instrumentation, providing depth to students' understanding of the phenomena taught in lecture. Specific experimental measurements include accelerated motion, periodic motion, gravitational force, ballistics, conservation of energy and momentum, and rotational dynamics. Students complete a weekly lab report.

This page includes all the experiment for:
- Gen Phys I --- PHYS1171 & PHYS1145
- Gen Phys II --- PHYS1172 & PHYS1146
